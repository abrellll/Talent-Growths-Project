# Talent Growths Performance Analysis Project

The Talent-Growths-Project is an in-depth evaluation of the company’s sales and profit performance across diverse channels, industries, and categories. The project aims to provide actionable insights by identifying the top-performing and underperforming sales channels, thereby revealing the strengths and weaknesses in the company’s sales strategy. The analysis extends to discovering the most profitable industries and categories, offering a clear understanding of where the company’s primary sources of profit lie.

A key aspect of the project involves assessing the performance of the primary persons in charge (PIC) to pinpoint the individuals contributing most and least to overall profit generation. Furthermore, profit trends for the year 2020 are analyzed to inform strategic decisions regarding future business operations. The comprehensive findings will aid the company in optimizing resources, enhancing its strategic focus, and determining the feasibility of continuing certain business operations.

This project provides a robust framework for understanding the company’s financial landscape and assists in guiding strategic growth initiatives.
