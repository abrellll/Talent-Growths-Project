# Talent-Growths-Project

The project involved a comprehensive analysis of sales and profit performance across various channels, industries, and categories for the company. The top two sales channels with the best performance were identified, as well as the two channels with the poorest results. Additionally, the analysis highlighted the two most profitable industries and categories for the company, providing insight into where the business generates the most profit. The performance of the key persons in charge (PIC) was also evaluated, identifying the PIC with the highest and lowest profit generation. An analysis of profit trends for 2020 was conducted, followed by a recommendation on whether the company should consider continuing its operations.
